                    <li>in a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites and almond extract until soft peaks form. gradually add remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar until stiff peaks form, and sugar is dissolved. using a flexible spatula, fold in almond mixture. spread meringue on prepared pan into a rectangle approximately 8 x 11 x 1/2-inch thick. smooth and square edges.</li>
                    <li>bake in a 200 degree Fahrenheit oven for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours, until meringue is a light ivory color and slightly crisp. turn off oven; leave meringue in oven with door closed for 1 hour. remove from oven and cool completely.</li>
                    <li>to soften ice cream, place containers in refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. scoop ice cream onto baked meringue. spread into an even layer. return to freezer.</li>
                    <li>put chocolate chips into a heavy-duty zip-top plastic bag. heat in microwave oven 2 minutes, or just until chips begin to soften. knead bag to completely melt chips. snip about 1/8-inch off a bottom corner of bag. drizzle chocolate onto ice cream in a zig-zag pattern. cover with double layers of plastic wrap and return to freezer until completely re-frozen, 4 hours or overnight. to serve, cut into approximately 2 x 3-inch bars. can be made up to 3 days ahead.</li>
